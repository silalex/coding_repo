    " - Task 7 has a duration of 150 minutes (2 hours and 30 minutes).\n",
    " - Total task time: 60 (Task 1) + 120 (Task 2) + 60 (Task 3) + 150 (Task 7) - 30 (overlap) = 360 minutes = 6 hours.\n",
    " - Maximum concurrent tasks: 2 (during the overlap period).\n",
    "\n",
    "2) For employee ID 1002:\n",
    " - Task 4 and Task 5 overlap from 09:30 to 10:00 (30 minutes).\n",
    " - Total task time: 60 (Task 4) + 120 (Task 5) - 30 (overlap) = 150 minutes = 2 hours and 30 minutes.\n",
    " - Total task hours (rounded down): 2 hours.\n",
    " - Maximum concurrent tasks: 2 (during the overlap period).\n",
    "\n",
    "3) For employee ID 1003:\n",
    " - No overlapping tasks.\n",
    " - Total task time: 120 minutes = 2 hours.\n",
    " - Maximum concurrent tasks: 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Output table is ordered by employee_id in ascending order.\n",
