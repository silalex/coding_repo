    "  - There were 4 requests in total, 2 of which were canceled.\n",
    "  - However, the request with Id=2 was made by a banned client (User_Id=2), so it is ignored in the calculation.\n",
    "  - Hence there are 3 unbanned requests in total, 1 of which was canceled.\n",
    "  - The Cancellation Rate is (1 / 3) = 0.33\n",
    "On 2013-10-02:\n",
    "  - There were 3 requests in total, 0 of which were canceled.\n",
    "  - The request with Id=6 was made by a banned client, so it is ignored.\n",
    "  - Hence there are 2 unbanned requests in total, 0 of which were canceled.\n",
    "  - The Cancellation Rate is (0 / 2) = 0.00\n",
    "On 2013-10-03:\n",
    "  - There were 3 requests in total, 1 of which was canceled.\n",
    "  - The request with Id=8 was made by a banned client, so it is ignored.\n",
    "  - Hence there are 2 unbanned request in total, 1 of which were canceled.\n",
    "  - The Cancellation Rate is (1 / 2) = 0.50\n",
