    "## Picking Numbers (20 points)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Given an array of integers, find the longest subarray where the absolute difference between any two elements is less than or equal to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example\n",
    "a = [1,1,2,2,4,4,5,5,5]\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two subarrays meeting the criterion: [1,1,2,2] and [4,4,5,5,5]. The maximum length subarray has 5 elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Function Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Complete the pickingNumbers function in the editor below.\n",
    "\n",
    "pickingNumbers has the following parameter(s):\n",
    " - int a[n]: an array of integers\n",
    "\n",
    "Returns\n",
    " - int: the length of the longest subarray that meets the criterion\n",
    "\n",
    "Input Format\n",
    "The first line contains a single integer n, the size of the array a.\n",
    "The second line contains n space-separated integers, each an a[i].\n",
    "\n",
    "Constraints\n",
    " - 2 <= n <= 100\n",
    " - 0 < a[i] < 100\n",
    " - The answer will be >= 2.\n",

    "Explanation:\n",
    "We choose the following multiset of integers from the array: [4,3,3]. Each pair in the multiset has an absolute difference <=1 (i.e., |4 - 3| = 1 and |3 - 3| = 0), so we print the number of chosen integers, 3, as our answer.\n",
