    "## Grading Students\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "HackerLand University has the following grading policy:\n",
    "- Every student receives a grade in the inclusive range from 0 to 100.\n",
    "- Any grade less than 40 is a failing grade.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sam is a professor at the university and likes to round each student's grade according to these rules:\n",
    "- If the difference between the grade and the next multiple of 5 is less than 3, round grade up to the next multiple of 5.\n",
    "- If the value of grade is less than 38, no rounding occurs as the result will still be a failing grade.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "- grade = 84: round to 85 (85 - 84 is less than 3)\n",
    "- grade = 29: do not round (result is less than 38)\n",
    "- grade = 57: do not round (60 - 57 is 3 or higher)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the initial value of grade for each of Sam's 'n' students, write code to automate the rounding process.\n",

    "#### Function Description\n",
    "```\n",
    "Complete the function 'gradingStudents' with the following parameter(s):\n",
    "- int grades[n] : the grades before rounding\n",
    "```\n",
    "#### Returns\n",
    "```\n",
    "- int[n] : the grades after rounding\n",
    "```\n",
    "#### Input Format\n",
    "```\n",
    "The first line contains a single integer, 'n', the number of students.\n",
    "Each line 'i' of the  subsequent lines contains a single integer, grades[i].\n",
    "\n",
    "Sample Input 0\n",
    "4 (how many students?)\n",
    "73\n",
