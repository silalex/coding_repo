    "## Dictionary\n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionaries are used to store data values in key:value pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "A dictionary is a collection which is ordered*, changeable and do not allow duplicates.\n",
    "\n",
    "As of Python version 3.7, dictionaries are ordered. In Python 3.6 and earlier, dictionaries are unordered.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionaries are written with curly brackets, and have keys and values:\n",

    "### Ordered or Unordered?\n",
    "As of Python version 3.7, dictionaries are ordered. In Python 3.6 and earlier, dictionaries are unordered.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we say that dictionaries are ordered, it means that the items have a defined order, and that order will not change.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unordered means that the items do not have a defined order, you cannot refer to an item by using an index.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Changeable\n",
    "Dictionaries are changeable, meaning that we can change, add or remove items after the dictionary has been created.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Duplicates Not Allowed\n",
    "Dictionaries cannot have two items with the same key:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Example: Duplicate values will overwrite existing values:\n",
    "\n",
    "thisdict = {\n",
    "  \"brand\": \"Ford\",\n",
    "  \"model\": \"Mustang\",\n",
    "  \"year\": 1964,\n",
    "  \"year\": 2020\n",
    "}\n",
    "print(thisdict)    --> {'brand': 'Ford', 'model': 'Mustang', 'year': 2020}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Get Keys\n",
    "The keys() method will return a list of all the keys in the dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Get a list of the keys:\n",
    "\n",
    "x = thisdict.keys()\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Get Values\n",
    "The values() method will return a list of all the values in the dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Get a list of the values:\n",
    "\n",
    "x = thisdict.values()\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Get Items\n",
    "The items() method will return each item in a dictionary, as tuples in a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Get a list of the key:value pairs\n",
    "\n",
    "x = thisdict.items()\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Check if Key Exists\n",
    "To determine if a specified key is present in a dictionary use the in keyword:\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Check if \"model\" is present in the dictionary\n",
    "```\n",
    "thisdict = {\n",
    "  \"brand\": \"Ford\",\n",
    "  \"model\": \"Mustang\",\n",
    "  \"year\": 1964\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "if \"model\" in thisdict:\n",
    "  print(\"Yes, 'model' is one of the keys in the thisdict dictionary\")\n",
    "--> Output: Yes, 'model' is one of the keys in the thisdict dictionary\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Loop Through a Dictionary\n",
    "You can loop through a dictionary by using a for loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "When looping through a dictionary, the return value are the keys of the dictionary, but there are methods to return the values as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Example: Print all key names in the dictionary, one by one:\n",
    "\n",
    "thisdict =\t{\n",
    "  \"brand\": \"Ford\",\n",
    "  \"model\": \"Mustang\",\n",
    "  \"year\": 1964\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "for x in thisdict:\n",
    "  print(x)\n",
    "--> Output: brand\n",
    "            model\n",
    "            year\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Print all values in the dictionary, one by one:\n",
    "\n",
    "for x in thisdict:\n",
    "  print(thisdict[x])\n",
    "--> Output: Ford\n",
    "            Mustang\n",
    "            1964\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: You can also use the values() method to return values of a dictionary:\n",
    "\n",
    "for x in thisdict.values():\n",
    "  print(x)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: You can use the keys() method to return the keys of a dictionary:\n",
    "\n",
    "for x in thisdict.keys():\n",
    "  print(x)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Loop through both keys and values, by using the items() method:\n",
    "\n",
    "for x, y in thisdict.items():\n",
    "  print(x, y)\n",
    "--> Output: brand Ford\n",
    "            model Mustang\n",
    "            year 1964\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Copy a Dictionary\n",
    "You cannot copy a dictionary simply by typing dict2 = dict1, because: dict2 will only be a reference to dict1, and changes made in dict1 will automatically also be made in dict2.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are ways to make a copy, one way is to use the built-in Dictionary method copy().\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Make a copy of a dictionary with the copy() method:\n",
    "```\n",
    "thisdict = {\n",
    "  \"brand\": \"Ford\",\n",
    "  \"model\": \"Mustang\",\n",
    "  \"year\": 1964\n",
    "}\n",
    "mydict = thisdict.copy()\n",
    "print(mydict)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to make a copy is to use the built-in function dict().\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Make a copy of a dictionary with the dict() function:\n",
    "\n",
    "thisdict = {\n",
    "  \"brand\": \"Ford\",\n",
    "  \"model\": \"Mustang\",\n",
    "  \"year\": 1964\n",
    "}\n",
    "mydict = dict(thisdict)\n",
    "print(mydict)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Loop Through Nested Dictionaries\n",
    "You can loop through a dictionary by using the items() method like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Example: Loop through the keys and values of all nested dictionaries:\n",
    "\n",
    "for x, obj in myfamily.items():\n",
    "  print(x)\n",
    "\n",
    "  for y in obj:\n",
    "    print(y + ':', obj[y])\n",
    "```"
